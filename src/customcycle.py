    """Find simple cycles (elementary circuits) of a directed graph.

    A `simple cycle`, or `elementary circuit`, is a closed path where
    no node appears twice. Two elementary circuits are distinct if they
    are not cyclic permutations of each other.

    This is a nonrecursive, iterator/generator version of Johnson's
    algorithm [1]_.  There may be better algorithms for some cases [2]_ [3]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX DiGraph
       A directed graph

    Returns
    -------
    cycle_generator: generator
       A generator that produces elementary cycles of the graph.
       Each cycle is represented by a list of nodes along the cycle.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> edges = [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph(edges)
    >>> len(list(nx.simple_cycles(G)))
    5

    To filter the cycles so that they don't include certain nodes or edges,
    copy your graph and eliminate those nodes or edges before calling

    >>> copyG = G.copy()
    >>> copyG.remove_nodes_from([1])
    >>> copyG.remove_edges_from([(0, 1)])
    >>> len(list(nx.simple_cycles(copyG)))
    3


    Notes
    -----
    The implementation follows pp. 79-80 in [1]_.

    The time complexity is $O((n+e)(c+1))$ for $n$ nodes, $e$ edges and $c$
    elementary circuits.
